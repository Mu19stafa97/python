purpose:This is a guessing game that is based on an algorithm called a “binary search”. The goal is to guess a number
        within a certain range in the fewest number of guesses. The game has two participants, one (the holder)
        is holding a secret number selected at random. The other (the guesser) will make guesses at what the
        number is. When the guesser makes a guess, the holder tells the guesser if the guess is correct or if the
        secret number is higher or lower than the guess. The guesser has a limited number of guesses.
        In this game the holder is the program.
        The guesser is the user
